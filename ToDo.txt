9. Make gallery creator component reusable for user panel (should be easy)

* Maybe don't have users re-visit pieces they already rated if logged in?
* Galleries can be creator or deleted, but not modified!!!
    This has some problems if works change?  need to keep only references to
    works because of this maybe?  Possibly okay because price and stuff aren't
    listed and it links back, we will leave for now...

* NEED TO DO TESTING
* NEED TO BUILD BETTER WORKFLOW POSSIBLY? (Maybe gulp)?

* FIRECHAT would be great for a live chat system, not really what we want for messages?

Structure of database
-Galleries
-S3auth
-artSearch
-users
-works
-messages


goal of database, keep everything as flat as possible and store references around. (or maybe dont store references, rely on queries from database when speed doesn't matter maybe?)  Also, it is okay to have rendundancy, for example in the works, but just make sure to keep everything updated together.
