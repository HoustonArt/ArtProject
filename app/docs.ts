export var DOCS: string[] = {"About": "<p>ArtLike is a community for artists and those who enjoy art.  We hope to promote sharing of art through online interactions as well as fostering personal connections between artists and those who love art.  We are continuing to create and explore new features and forms of interactions and would love to get your input.</p>\n\n<p>We are not a sales service, although we are a sales platform and we do not charge commission on work sold.  We hope that this will allow artists to reap the full benefit of their efforts and also lower the prices in general.  We hope to become a new form of gallery which focuses more on connecting people than sales.</p>\n\n<p>This documentation gives a detailed explanation of how to use the features of ArtLike and some of our motivation for creating them.  If you as the user have anything to add to the documentation or personal stories of your own use, we would again love to hear from you at <a href=\"m&#97;&#x69;&#x6c;&#116;&#111;&#58;a&#x72;&#116;&#x6c;&#x69;&#x6b;&#x65;&#105;&#x6f;&#x40;&#x67;&#x6d;&#x61;&#x69;&#108;&#46;&#x63;o&#x6d;\">a&#x72;&#116;&#x6c;&#x69;&#x6b;&#x65;&#105;&#x6f;&#x40;&#x67;&#x6d;&#x61;&#x69;&#108;&#46;&#x63;o&#x6d;</a></p>\n", "GalleryDesigner": "<p>Ever want to curate your own show?  The Gallery Creator tool offers an opportunity to curate your own collection of works drawing from the effort of all of our ArtLike users.  The resulting Gallery can be shared through a web url with anyone who can access the internet.  It is a great way to promote your work and share it with others.</p>\n\n<h2>How to Create a Gallery</h2>\n\n<p>To use this tool, go to the GalleryDesigner tab.  First you will be walked through entering some basic information:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gallery Name</strong> - Name of the gallery to be created</li>\n<li><strong>Curator</strong> - Name of curator (probably your name)</li>\n<li><strong>Description</strong> (optional) - Description of the gallery</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Enter these and press next.  Don't worry, if you mess up you can always press the previous button, or change it at a later point in time.  Once you have entered these, you will come to another screen where you can change the appearance of the gallery as well as continue to edit the information.</p>\n\n<p>You will see several fields of entry:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gallery</strong> Name - Name of the gallery to be created</li>\n<li><strong>Curator</strong> - Name of curator (probably your name)</li>\n<li><strong>Description</strong> (optional) - Description of the gallery</li>\n<li><strong>Size</strong> - Size of images to appear in the gallery.</li>\n<li><strong>Select Art</strong> - Box to select art from the site</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The select art box allows you to select art by artist and when you click on a\nwork, it will appear in the gallery on the right (or below on a smaller screen).</p>\n\n<p>Once you have entered a Gallery Name and curator, you can preview the gallery by clicking on the blue preview button below.</p>\n\n<p>To create the gallery, click on the green create page button.  This will create a link to the gallery which you can copy and share with anyone you wish.
