To submit a work to ArtLike, one must first have a user account created (see Login documentation for help on how to do this).  Then click on the new work button on the bottom of the page or on your profile picture.

After filling out the form and pressing submit, you should be able to go to the user panel and see your work as well as your artist page.

Works can be deleted on either the user panel or the work page itself (if it is your work).

*Note*: We will do the best we can to filter work that is not appropriate to the mission of our site, however, we will not necessarily catch this immediately
