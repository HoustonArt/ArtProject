To submit a work to ArtLike, one must first have a user account created (see Login documentation for help on how to do this).  Then click on the new work button on the bottom of the page or on your profile picture.

The fields of the form are:

* Title - Name of the art piece.
* Media - Type of media with which you have created your piece.  It is not important that it fall into a specified category, be specific.
* Description - Here you can enter a description of your work.  This field is not required, but it can be very useful to appreciate the work.  However, if you do not wish to add a description, you may leave this field blank.
* Price - The price of sale in American dollars.  This amount is not legally binding, but it should represent a fair and honest price for your piece.  All prices should be in American currency.
* Height - Height of the art piece in inches.
* Width - Width of the art piece in inches.
* Depth - Depth of the art piece in inches.  If the piece is two dimensional, please enter zero here.


After filling out the form and pressing submit, you should be able to go to the user panel and see your work as well as your artist page.

Works can be deleted on either the user panel or the work page itself (if it is your work).

We gather this information because it helps us to understand the art in the ArtLike collection as well as to help appreciators of the art, especially potential buyers have enough information to make informed decisions.  Any information that you give to us in this form will be publicly available.

*Note*: We will do the best we can to filter work that is not appropriate to the mission of our site, however, we will not necessarily catch these immediately.  Additionally, as this is an art website, there will be depictions of the human body, we will use our best judgment as to what is "art."  Please email artlikeio@gmail with any concerns or to flag work as not appropriate.
