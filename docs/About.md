ArtLike is a community for artists and those who enjoy art.  We hope to promote sharing of art through online interactions as well as fostering personal connections between artists and those who love art.  We are continuing to create and explore new features and forms of interactions and would love to get your input.

This documentation gives a detailed explanation of how to use the features of ArtLike and some of our motivation for creating them.  If you as the user have anything to add to the documentation or personal stories of your own use, we would again love to hear from you.
