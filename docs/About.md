ArtLike is a community for artists and those who enjoy art.  We hope to promote sharing of art through online interactions as well as fostering personal connections between artists and those who love art.  We are continuing to create and explore new features and forms of interactions and would love to get your input.

Some services that we provide are:
1. Artist page with information and work showcase
2. Easy creation of individual pages for each artwork
3. Gallery creation
4. Communication platform for sales
5. Art search

We are not a sales service, although we can be used as a sales platform and we do not charge commission on work sold.  We hope that this will allow artists to reap the full benefit of their efforts and also lower the prices in general.  We hope to become a new form of gallery which focuses more on connecting people than sales.


This documentation gives a detailed explanation of how to use the features of ArtLike and some of our motivation for creating them.  If you as the user have anything to add to the documentation or personal stories of your own use, we would again love to hear from you at <artlikeio@gmail.com>
