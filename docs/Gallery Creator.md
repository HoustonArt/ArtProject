Ever want to curate your own show?  The Gallery Creator tool offers an opportunity to curate your own collection of works drawing from the effort of all of our ArtLike users.  The resulting Gallery can be shared through a web url with anyone who can access the internet.  It is a great way to promote your work and share it with others.

To use this tool, go to the GalleryDesigner tab.  You will see several fields of entry:

* Gallery Name - Name of the gallery to be created
* Curator - Name of curator (probably your name)
* Description (optional) - Description of the gallery
* Size - Size of images to appear in the gallery.
* Select Art - Box to select art from the site

The select art box allows you to select art by artist and when you click on a
work, it will appear in the gallery on the right (or below on a smaller screen).

Once you have entered a Gallery Name and curator, you can preview the gallery by clicking on the blue preview button below.

To create the gallery, click on the green create page button.  This will create a link to the gallery which you can copy and share with anyone you wish.  The link will persist even after your session ends.

 Works deleted by their owner will eventually be removed from containing galleries.
