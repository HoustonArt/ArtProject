"description": "I was born and raised in Ft. Worth, Texas  I earned a B. A. and an M. A., in English literature at Rice University. I studied medieval English poetry and prose at the University of Texas in Austin. I love to eat, but would rather read. I am a perennial student of Spanish, and I have a special fondness for the United Kingdom, France, Mexico, Portugal, Brazil, Kenya, and Bulgaria.  <br>  In 2001 I moved back to Houston, Texas, from  Arlington, Virginia, to open a Macromedia and Adobe Authorized Center, Connect Learning, which closed in 2011. <br>I am fortunate to have two sisters,  two sons and four grandchildren."
