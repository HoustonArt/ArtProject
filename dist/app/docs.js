We hope to promote sharing of art through online interactions as well as fostering personal connections between artists and those who love art.  We are continuing to create and explore new features and forms of interactions and would love to get your input.</p>\n\n<p>We are not a sales service, although we are a sales platform.  ArtLike does not charge commission on work sold.  We hope that this will allow artists to reap the full benefit of their efforts and also lower the prices in general.  We hope to become a new form of gallery which focuses more on connecting people than sales.</p>\n\n<p>This documentation gives a detailed explanation of how to use the features of ArtLike and some of our motivation for creating them.  If you as the user have anything to add to the documentation or personal stories of your own use, we would again love to hear from you.</p>\n", "Gallery Creator": "<p>Ever want to curate your own show?  The Gallery Creator tool offers an opportunity to curate your own collection of works drawing from the effort of all of our ArtLike users.  The resulting Gallery can be shared through a web url with anyone who can access the internet.  It is a great way to promote your work and share it with others.</p>\n\n<p>To use this tool, go to the GalleryDesigner tab.  You will see several fields of entry:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Gallery Name - Name of the gallery to be created</li>\n<li>Curator - Name of curator (probably your name)</li>\n<li>Description (optional) - Description of the gallery</li>\n<li>Size - Size of images to appear in the gallery.</li>\n<li>Select Art - Box to select art from the site</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The select art box allows you to select art by artist and when you click on a\nwork, it will appear in the gallery on the right (or below on a smaller screen).</p>\n\n<p>Once you have entered a Gallery Name and curator, you can preview the gallery by clicking on the blue preview button below.</p>\n\n<p>To create the gallery, click on the green create page button.  This will create a link to the gallery which you can copy and share with anyone you wish.  The link will persist even after your session ends.</p>\n\n<p>Works deleted by their owner will eventually be removed from containing galleries.</p>\n", "Login": "<p>To log to ArtLike, one must first create an account.  To do this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>click on the \"New User\" link in the upper right hand corner of the screen.</li>\n<li>Click the \"Sign Up\" button at the bottom.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>After this you are ready to log into your account and you can use all of the ArtLike functionality.  Remember that <em>all</em> ArtLike services are free to try and in fact we encourage you to explore and give feedback on all services!  Feedback can be given to artlikeio@gmail.com.</p>\n\n<p>An account at ArtLike allows you to do several important things</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Upload your own works</li>\n<li>Create galleries</li>\n<li>Send messages to other users </li>\n</ul>\n", "Messages": "<p>Messages are a great way to communicate with other ArtLike users.  On any work page or artist page, click on the button to send a message.  Received messages are visible in your user panel.</p>\n", "New Work": "<p>To submit a work to ArtLike, one must first have a user account created (see Login documentation for help on how to do this).  Then click on the new work button on the bottom of the page or on your profile picture.</p>\n\n<p>After filling out the form and pressing submit, you should be able to go to the user panel and see your work as well as your artist page.</p>\n\n<p>Works can be deleted on either the user panel or the work page itself (if it is your work).</p>\n\n<p><em>Note</em>: We will do the best we can to filter work that is not appropriate to the mission of our site, however, we will not necessarily catch these immediately.  Additionally, as this is an art website, there will be depictions of the human body, we will use our best judgment as to what is \"art.\"  Please email artlikeio@gmail with any concerns or to flag work as not appropriate.</p>\n" });
