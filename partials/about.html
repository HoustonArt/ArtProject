      <p>We are a community of artists, art enthusiasts, and people who just like looking at art. We seek to find matches for artists and art lovers.  ArtLike is a free service.  At first each user has a limited amount of allowed uploaded works, but shoot us an email if you love our service and want some more space!</p>
      <p>We are currently in the beta stage of our journey, but we hope to release all features in the near future.  Please let us know if there is any particular feature you want to have!</p>

      <p>Currently we are still in beta, so this tier structure is not active.  We reserve the right to change the pricing structure at any point in time.  All subscriptions are on a sixth month basis and if there is a price change, it will not effect charges already paid.</p>
      <p> Some of the technologies we use are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Angular2</li>
        <li>Bootstrap</li>
        <li>Firebase</li>
      </ul>
      <p> If you are interested in helping to build this community or have any questions or comments, please send an email to <a href="artlikeio@gmail.com">artlikeio@gmail.com</a></p>
